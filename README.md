# ShapeChange-ModLoader-Docs
Shape Change Modding Documentation.


Here's simple explaination on what everything is:


<b>Installation.md</b> - explains how to install mods.

<b>ModCreation.md</b> - explains how to create C# mods.

<b>APIReference.md</b> - list of classes, variables and methods Shape Change uses.

<b>SupportedStartupScripts.md</b> - what stuff can also be used for modding.
For now it lacks proper documentation and some things are untested.
