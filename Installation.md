In order to install mod into Shape Change you need to:
Put the .zip file into Mods folder in Shape Change or DG Shape Change folder.
To figure out what you are running, remember what OS you are running.
If earlier than Windows 7, then DG version. If not, Shape Change.

Well that was long, wasn't it?

To check if it started, go into Sethings, ModLoader.
If you can't find installed mod inside:

 - Cry about it.
 - Tell author to cry about it.

NOTE:
You CAN'T run DG Shape Change's mods in Shape Change and vise versa.
